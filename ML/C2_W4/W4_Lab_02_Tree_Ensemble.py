We can see that in general, reducing max_depth can help to reduce overfitting.

Reducing max_depth from 8 to 4 increases validation accuracy closer to training accuracy, while significantly reducing training accuracy.
The validation accuracy reaches the highest at tree_depth=4.
When the max_depth is smaller than 3, both training and validation accuracy decreases. 
The tree cannot make enough splits to distinguish positives from negatives (the model is underfitting the training set).

When the max_depth is too high ( >= 5), validation accuracy decreases while training accuracy increases, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training set.

So we can choose the best values for these two hyper-parameters for our model to be:

max_depth = 4
min_samples_split = 50

################# 4.2 Random Forest #################
"""
Now let's try the Random Forest algorithm also, using the Scikit-learn implementation.

All of the hyperparameters found in the decision tree model will also exist in this algorithm, since a random forest is an ensemble of many Decision Trees.
One additional hyperparameter for Random Forest is called n_estimators which is the number of Decision Trees that make up the Random Forest.

Remember that for a Random Forest, we randomly choose a subset of the features AND randomly choose a subset of the training examples to train each individual tree.

Following the lectures, if n is the number of features, we will randomly select sqrt(n) of these features to train each individual tree.
Note that you can modify this by setting the max_features parameter.

You can also speed up your training jobs with another parameter, n_jobs.

Since the fitting of each tree is independent of each other, it is possible fit more than one tree in parallel.
So setting n_jobs higher will increase how many CPU cores it will use. Note that the numbers very close to the maximum cores of your CPU may impact on the overall performance of your PC and even lead to freezes.
Changing this parameter does not impact on the final result but can reduce the training time.
We will run the same script again, but with another parameter, n_estimators, where we will choose between 10, 50, and 100. The default is 100.

When we only modify one hyperparameter while leaving the rest as their default value, we are trying 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 results.
To try out all combinations, we can use a sklearn implementation called GridSearchCV. GridSearchCV has a refit parameter that will automatically refit a model on the best combination so we will not need to program it explicitly. For more on GridSearchCV, please refer to its documentation.

################# 4.3 XGBoost #################
"""
Next is the Gradient Boosting model, called XGBoost. The boosting methods train several trees, 
but instead of them being uncorrelated to each other, now the trees are fit one after the other in order to minimize the error.

The model has the same parameters as a decision tree, plus the learning rate.

The learning rate is the size of the step on the Gradient Descent method that the XGBoost uses internally to minimize the error on each train step.
One interesting thing about the XGBoost is that during fitting, it can take in an evaluation dataset of the form (X_val,y_val).

On each iteration, it measures the cost (or evaluation metric) on the evaluation datasets.
Once the cost (or metric) stops decreasing for a number of rounds (called early_stopping_rounds), the training will stop.
More iterations lead to more estimators, and more estimators can result in overfitting.
By stopping once the validation metric no longer improves, we can limit the number of estimators created, and reduce overfitting.
"""

#First, let's define a subset of our training set (we should not use the test set here).

"""
Note some of the .fit() parameters:

eval_set = [(X_train_eval,y_train_eval)]:Here we must pass a list to the eval_set, because you can have several different tuples of eval sets.

early_stopping_rounds: This parameter helps to stop the model training if its evaluation metric is no longer improving on the validation set. It's set to 10.

    The model keeps track of the round with the best performance (lowest evaluation metric). For example, let's say round 16 has the lowest evaluation metric so far.

    Each successive round's evaluation metric is compared to the best metric. If the model goes 10 rounds where none have a better metric than the best one, then the model stops training.

    The model is returned at its last state when training terminated, not its state during the best round. For example, if the model stops at round 26, but the best round was 16, the model's training state at round 26 is returned, not round 16.

    Note that this is different from returning the model's "best" state (from when the evaluation metric was the lowest).
