############### 1 - Implementing K-means ###################
"""
The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data points together.

Concretely, you are given a training set  {x(1),...,x(ùëö)}
 , and you want to group the data into a few cohesive ‚Äúclusters‚Äù.
K-means is an iterative procedure that
Starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then
Refines this guess by
Repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids, and then
Recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.

In pseudocode, the K-means algorithm is as follows:

  # Initialize centroids
  # K is the number of clusters
  centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X, K)

  for iter in range(iterations):
      # Cluster assignment step: 
      # Assign each data point to the closest centroid. 
      # idx[i] corresponds to the index of the centroid 
      # assigned to example i
      idx = find_closest_centroids(X, centroids)

      # Move centroid step: 
      # Compute means based on centroid assignments
      centroids = compute_centroids(X, idx, K)

The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps:
1. Assigning each training example  x(i) to its closest centroid, and
2. Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it.

The  K -means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids.

However, the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids.

    Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations.
    One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion).

################ 3 - Random initialization ###################
"""
The initial assignments of centroids for the example dataset was designed so that you will see the same figure as in Figure 1. In practice, a good strategy for initializing the centroids is to select random examples from the training set.

In this part of the exercise, you should understand how the function kMeans_init_centroids is implemented.

    The code first randomly shuffles the indices of the examples (using np.random.permutation()).
    Then, it selects the first $K$ examples based on the random permutation of the indices.
    This allows the examples to be selected at random without the risk of selecting the same example twice.

################ 4 - Image compression with K-means ###################
"""
In this exercise, you will apply K-means to image compression.

    In a straightforward 24-bit color representation of an image, each pixel is represented as three 8-bit unsigned integers (ranging from 0 to 255) that specify the red, green and blue intensity values. This encoding is often refered to as the RGB encoding.

    Our image contains thousands of colors, and in this part of the exercise, you will reduce the number of colors to 16 colors.

    By making this reduction, it is possible to represent (compress) the photo in an efficient way.

    Specifically, you only need to store the RGB values of the 16 selected colors, and for each pixel in the image you now need to only store the index of the color at that location (where only 4 bits are necessary to represent 16 possibilities).


In this part, you will use the K-means algorithm to select the 16 colors that will be used to represent the compressed image.

    Concretely, you will treat every pixel in the original image as a data example and use the K-means algorithm to find the 16 colors that best group (cluster) the pixels in the 3- dimensional RGB space.
    Once you have computed the cluster centroids on the image, you will then use the 16 colors to replace the pixels in the original image.

"""


###### 4.1 Dataset ######

# Load an image of a bird
original_img = plt.imread('C3_W1/bird_small.png')

# Visualizing the image
plt.imshow(original_img) 
plt.show()

# Check the dimension of the variable
print("Shape of original_img is:", original_img.shape)

"""
As you can see, this creates a three-dimensional matrix original_img where

    the first two indices identify a pixel position, and
    the third index represents red, green, or blue.

For example, original_img[50, 33, 2] gives the blue intensity of the pixel at row 50 and column 33.
"""


### Processing data ###
"""
To call the run_kMeans, you need to first transform the matrix original_img into a two-dimensional matrix.

The code below reshapes the matrix original_img to create an  ùëöx3 matrix of pixel colors (where  ùëö=16384=128x128)

Note: If you'll try this exercise later on a JPG file, you first need to divide the pixel values by 255 so it will be in the range 0 to 1. 
This is not necessary for PNG files (e.g. bird_small.png) because it is already loaded in the required range (as mentioned in the plt.imread() documentation). 
We commented a line below for this so you can just uncomment it later in case you want to try a different file.
"""

# Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1 (not needed for PNG files)
# original_img = original_img / 255

# Reshape the image into an m x 3 matrix where m = number of pixels
# (in this case m = 128 x 128 = 16384)
# Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
# This gives us our dataset matrix X_img that we will use K-Means on.

X_img = np.reshape(original_img, (original_img.shape[0] * original_img.shape[1], 3))
print("Shape of X_img is:", X_img.shape)

"""
The code below will plot all the colors found in the original image. 
As mentioned earlier, the color of each pixel is represented by RGB values so the plot should have 3 axes -- R, G, and B. 
You'll notice a lot of dots below representing thousands of colors in the original image. 
The red markers represent the centroids after running K-means. These will be the 16 colors that you will use to compress the image.

plot_kMeans_RGB(X_img, centroids, idx, K)

###### 4.3 Compress the image ######
"""
After finding the top  K=16 colors to represent the image, you can now assign each pixel position to its closest centroid using the find_closest_centroids function.

This allows you to represent the original image using the centroid assignments of each pixel.

Notice that you have significantly reduced the number of bits that are required to describe the image.

    The original image required 24 bits (i.e. 8 bits x 3 channels in RGB encoding) for each one of the  128x128 pixel locations, 
    resulting in total size of  128x128x24=393,216 bits.

    The new representation requires some overhead storage in form of a dictionary of 16 colors, each of which require 24 bits, 
    but the image itself then only requires 4 bits per pixel location.

    The final number of bits used is therefore  16x24+128x128x4=65,920 bits, which corresponds to compressing the original image by about a factor of 6.
"""

# Find the closest centroid of each pixel
idx = find_closest_centroids(X_img, centroids)

# Replace each pixel with the color of the closest centroid
X_recovered = centroids[idx, :] 

# Reshape image into proper dimensions

"""
Finally, you can view the effects of the compression by reconstructing the image based only on the centroid assignments.

    Specifically, you replaced each pixel with the value of the centroid assigned to it.

    Figure 3 shows a sample reconstruction. Even though the resulting image retains most of the characteristics 
    of the original, you will also see some compression artifacts because of the fewer colors used.
