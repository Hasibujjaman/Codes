method 1: using cmake

(i). fist inlcude the programs you want to test(e.g., sample_test.cpp) in the CMakeLists.txt file
(ii) to build/compile the test programs:  cmake -B build && make clean -C build && make -C build
(iii) to run a test program: ./sample_test





method 2: using direct makefile

make f=sample_test clean && make f=sample_test
