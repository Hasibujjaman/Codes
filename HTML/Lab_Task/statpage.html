        The statistical table presented provides a comprehensive overview of the annual sales performance of five
        different product categories over a five-year period. Each row corresponds to a specific product category,
        namely Electronics, Home Appliances, Furniture, Clothing, and Toys. The columns represent the years from 2019 to
        2023, detailing the total sales figures for each year. From the data, it is evident that Electronics
        consistently leads in sales, with a notable peak in 2021, possibly due to increased demand for remote work and
        learning tools during the pandemic. Home Appliances and Furniture show a steady growth trend, reflecting a
        rising consumer interest in home improvement. Clothing sales exhibit a slight decline, which could be attributed
        to changing fashion trends or economic factors. The Toys category shows fluctuating sales, with a significant
        increase in 2023, likely driven by new product launches or seasonal promotions. Overall, this table provides
        valuable insights into market dynamics and consumer behavior, highlighting areas of growth and potential
        challenges within each product category.
