    one $\backslash$= command separates two columns.

    The row is terminated by $\backslash$$\backslash$.

    The remaining rows are inserted in the same way, but replacing $\backslash$= with $\backslash$$\backslash$.

    \begin{tabbing} 
        Potato \= 12.00\\ %The \= command is used, usually in the first row, to generate a new column by ending the current column
        Rice \> 20.00\\  %The \> command moves the control to the next column in the subsequent rows
        Oil \> 60.00\\ % Each row is terminated by a line break command \\ to go to the next row
        Sugar \> 23.00  %the last row is not required to be terminated by \\
