Although LATEX decides the correct margin on its own without bothering a user, a problem may arise if an arrow is to be used in the margin to
point some texts. \marginpar{Marginal note} This is because, as shown in the margin of this line, a left-pointing arrow is required in the right margin and a right-pointing 
one is required in the left margin. \marginpar[$\longrightarrow$]{$\longleftarrow$} However, it is not known beforehand in which margin the arrow will appear,
for which it would be confusing whether a right-pointing or a left-pointing arrow is to be used.
