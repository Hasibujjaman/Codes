By default, /thispagestyle{plain} is issued by the document-classes of article, book, and report to the 
/maketitle command and the first page of major sectioning commands,like /part{ } or /chapter{ }. 
To suppress the effect of /thispagestyle{plain} on these pages, /thispagestyle{ } with an appropriate
 page style may be used just after the /maketitle, /part{ } or /chapter{ } command, 
 e.g., /thispagestyle{empty} may be used to suppress the default page numbering on these pages.
